description: Operate the requirement-driven delivery loop through the modernpath CLI — the exact verb sequences for plan, cold review, entry, build, evidence, completion and apply; the work-selection model; the three fingerprints and what moves them; every refusal the loop meets and the verb that clears it. Use whenever an rdd skill says to record, select, pull, push, trace, gate, answer or advance and the workspace is store-backed; flags and defaults are in the installed `.modernpath/cli-reference.md`.

# Operating the loop through the CLI

<!-- TOOL-OWNED. Installed by `modernpath install`. -->

The rdd skills say *what* a pass records; this skill says *how* the `modernpath`
CLI records it. Nothing here changes the process — `.modernpath/rdd/PROCESS.md`
owns the meanings. Every verb, flag and default of the installed binary is in
`.modernpath/cli-reference.md`, rendered from the binary itself by
`modernpath install`; look a flag up there rather than guessing it. Every command below is the sanctioned path: if a step needs
something the CLI does not expose, that is a tooling gap to surface through the
project's gap channel, never a reason to call the API or edit a store file by
hand (`PROCESS.md` §State records and reconciliation).

Sections marked **store-backed** apply only when `process/store-backed.md`
declares the store; in a file-backed workspace the ledger files are the store
and `modernpath author` is a rehearsal tool, not a write path.

Two rules from the project's agent instructions apply throughout: one store
command per shell call, and store writes only from the orchestrating session —
a delegated pass returns findings and a verdict.

`PROCESS.md` names phases and never a verb. In a store-backed workspace each
phase is driven by these entry points; the sections below give the order and
the flags. Each phase runs with the batch verbs first — one call per step,
whatever the number of records — and the single-record verbs stay as the
fallback, for one record or on a CLI that lacks the batch verb:

| Phase (`PROCESS.md`) | Batch verbs | Single-record fallback | Section |
|---|---|---|---|
| session preparation | `process prepare-inputs` | — | Where the loop stands |
| any — where do I stand | one `process next`, even with several held pieces; `process check --phase <p>`, `your-move`, `factory status` | `process next --piece <id>` | Where the loop stands |
| source → plan | `author apply --file <plan>`, `working-set select … --phase plan [--lane defect]`, `working-set pull --scope`, `working-set push` | `author epic` / `requirement` / `update` / `relate` / `member` | 1 |
| cold review | `working-set pull --scope --for-review` (one `REVIEW.md`), then `process review record --file <review.json>` | `process findings add` / `disposition`, `author trace --purpose cold-review` | 1 |
| entry | `process enter <scope>`, the human's `factory answer`, then `author advance --gate ENTRY-<scope>` | `author advance <id> … --to TODO` per record | 1 |
| build → verify | `factory evidence --file <runs.json>`, then `process advance --all --piece <EPIC>` | `factory evidence --fail --role RED`, `factory evidence --pass`, `process advance <SR>` per SR | 2 |
| completion → apply | `process complete <scope>`, the human's `factory answer`, then `author advance --gate COMPLETE-<scope>`, `working-set select --put-down` | `author advance <id> … --to DONE` per record | 2 |
| triage | `author requirement` / `author epic` / `author backlog`, `author gate --gate-kind question`, `modernpath feedback "<line>"` for a tooling gap; `author demote` to reopen a delivered item | — | The write channels |
| session | `auth status`, `env --set`, `factory status` | — | Where the loop stands; the reference |

## Where the loop stands (both modes)

In a bound workspace, run `modernpath process prepare-inputs` before sourced
work. It checks the binding, CLI/kit and server contract with one context read,
and reports the held-piece count, active release, pending decisions, local docs
last synced and server docs last updated. It does not refresh documents or
change process records. For scripts, `--json` reports `ready` and the separate
documentation timestamps; readiness does not mean the local docs are current.
Run `modernpath docs sync` explicitly when a refresh is needed. Search locally
first, in this order: the repository for the requirement id, its code and
tests; `modernpath working-set pull <id>`; the docs export
(`rg -n "<terms>" .modernpath/<system-slug>/`, then read the matching files);
then `modernpath ask` for why and how questions the local search cannot answer.
Use `modernpath search` or `modernpath read-doc` when the export lacks the
material or a live answer is needed.

After running `modernpath process prepare-inputs`, always show its complete
human-readable output verbatim in a fenced `text` block in the user-facing
response. Include every section, warning, and remedy, including a `Not ready`
result. A summary does not replace the output. Put timing and any explanation
outside the block.

| Read | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `modernpath process next` | the derived phase, why, and the skill to run; `-v` prints the full packet aggregate and process revision. With several held pieces and no `--piece` it prints one block per piece — scope, phase, why, the skill, the gates waiting on it — and exits 0: session entry is one call |
| `modernpath process check --phase <p>` | one phase's decision-table checks for the current selection (a pure read) |
| `modernpath your-move` | the pending human decisions, ranked by what one answer releases |
| `modernpath working-set pull <id>…` | a record as a readable file with its `Fingerprint:` line |
| `modernpath factory gates <gate-id>` | one gate: state, answer, chosen options, applied state |
| `modernpath factory status` / `modernpath status` | the binding and whether the workspace is store-backed |

Phases are `source`, `plan`, `cold_review`, `entry`, `build`, `verify`,
`completion`, `triage` — the vocabulary `--phase` accepts.

## The write channels (store-backed)

Every write is single-record and actor-attributed; legality is enforced by the
server, and a stale fingerprint conflicts instead of overwriting. The batch
verbs — `author apply`, `process review record`, the `--file` forms,
`author advance --gate` and `process advance --all` — run those same
single-record writes in one call, chain each fingerprint, and report every
record's result. Retired files
are not recreated to record something — a file-derived batch is refused whole.

| Channel | Carries |
|---|---|
| `modernpath author requirement`, `author epic`, `author update`, `author member`, `author relate` | records, content edits, membership and UR–SR relations. A user requirement's scenarios are `author update --criteria <json or file>`: a JSON array whose every object carries an `external_id` (the replace-set keys on it) and `given`, `when`, `then`; the array replaces the stored set whole |
| `modernpath author apply --file <plan.yaml\|json>` | a whole plan in one call: the epic, its URs and SRs with their prose and criteria, the UR–SR relations and the membership, through `working-set push`'s write engine. The whole plan is checked before the first write; a missing record is created, then each record is one atomic patch carrying the authoring context. An existing record it would change is guarded by its `working-set pull` or a pinned `expected_fingerprint`; a re-run writes nothing; `--dry-run` prints the plan |
| `modernpath author trace` | an immutable PASS/FAIL/STALE trace gate at an exact fingerprint |
| `modernpath author gate` / `author gate-withdraw` | a human gate, born open; `--supersedes <old>` retires an open or answered decision in the same write; a mistakenly opened one is withdrawn with a reason |
| `modernpath author advance` | a lifecycle transition; a human-gated one names the `ANSWERED` gate and its fingerprint. `author advance --gate <GATE>` with no id reads the gate — its fingerprint, the FROM and TO of its transition, an `approve` answer — and advances every record its scope names that is still in FROM, members first, then the epic |
| `modernpath author demote` | the demotion gate that reopens delivered items — one id, or `--ids A,B,C` / `--file` for one gate over several items of one state (`--to PROPOSED\|IN_PROGRESS\|OBSOLETE --basis reversed-decision\|defect\|superseded --reason USER:…`, no prerequisite trace); `--apply` (with `--gate-id`, or an id for the newest gate in its series) after the answer advances every item on it and reports the user requirements and epics that followed |
| `modernpath working-set select` | the frozen scope, its phase, suspension, resumption, put-down |
| `modernpath working-set push` | packet sections whole and item files as atomic patches, from the scope directory `pull --scope` materialized; push never creates a record: an item file whose id the store does not know is refused before any write — create it with `author apply`, the only create path; a `members/` file whose record the store holds outside the frozen selection is skipped and named — re-select to push it |
| `modernpath process review record --file <review.json>` | a delegated cold review in one call: the reviewer's findings, its guarded dispositions and the cold-review trace at the aggregate the review pull stamped |
| `modernpath process findings add` / `disposition` | cold-review findings and their dispositions, one per call or a whole list with `process findings add --file` and `process findings disposition --file` |
| `modernpath process reconcile --apply` | the automatic transitions current trace proofs allow |
| `modernpath process enter`, `process advance`, `process complete` | the ceremony verbs (EPIC-CLI-017): the entry gate, the lower trace plus reconcile, and the delivered-revision evidence plus completion trace plus completion gate — each from the store facts, each refusing before any write on an unmet fact; `process advance --all --piece <EPIC>` advances every SR of the piece |
| `modernpath factory evidence` | a test or browser run as evidence, pinned to the repository HEAD; `--role RED` marks a red-first result; `factory evidence --file <runs.json>` records several runs in one call |
| `modernpath factory answer` | an attributable human answer on an open gate (a governed gate's review is attached for you) |
| `modernpath install --store-backed --source USER:…` | the store-backed declaration of a bound workspace that never had file ledgers: the activation gate answered with the source, the server state `active` and the marker, in one step; a workspace with ledgers goes through `migrate flip` |
| `modernpath author backlog` / `author update --kind backlog` | one backlog, gap or tooling record (`BACKLOG-…`, `GAP-…`), born `OPEN` and attributed to you; a disposition change names its `--source`; `working-set pull <id>` renders it |

A triage discovery that is neither a requirement, an epic nor a gate is a
backlog record (`author backlog <id> --kind backlog`), a gap is `--kind gap`
with its `--gap-kind`, `--affected-trace` and `--consequence`, and a tooling
gap is `modernpath feedback "<line>"`. These are store records like every
other (`PROCESS.md` §State records and reconciliation): their state is read
from the store — `process backlog list [--kind backlog|gap|tooling]
[--disposition <word>]` lists them newest first and `working-set pull <id>`
reads one — never from a plan file or a note, which carry no disposition the
store does not. Tooling feedback requires a ModernPath tenant credential and
a current checkout bound to the server-verified `modernpath` system. It refuses
customer workspaces rather than switching destinations. It never
files tooling records or local fallback files in customer projects. When that
destination is unavailable, report the gap in the session; do not substitute
`author backlog --kind tooling` in the customer store. Read feedback records
from a checkout bound to ModernPath. The release
registry file is retired;
the single active release and its `USER:` source are the newest answered,
approved `release_selection` gate naming `release:<slug>` on the system —
`GATE-RELEASE-<slug>`, or a successor `GATE-RELEASE-<slug>-<n>` — written by
`factory release activate` on the system it runs from.

## 1. Plan → cold review → entry (store-backed)

### Plan

**Author the records.** One call records the whole plan:
`author apply --file plan.yaml` (YAML or JSON):

```
epic: {id, title, description, expected_fingerprint}
requirements:
  - {id, kind: ur|sr, context, title, description, rationale, boundary,
     verification_method, criteria: [...], parents: [UR ids],
     expected_fingerprint}
members: [requirement ids]
```

It runs through `working-set push`'s write engine. Every record is checked
before the first write — one invalid record (a new one with no title or
context, a lane class on a UR, a criterion without `external_id`) stops the
call and nothing is written. A record the store does not know is created,
then patched — apply is the only create path, and push never creates; each
record's changes — the fields that differ (an empty field
is left alone), its criteria, relations and membership — are one atomic patch
carrying the authoring context. Each record's line shows its result and
fingerprint; an updated one shows `<replaced> -> <new>`. A re-run writes
nothing and each record reads `unchanged`. `--dry-run` prints the plan.
A fingerprint conflict is reported for that record and the rest continue;
any other refusal stops the run and names what was written. A record created
whose patch never ran reads `created, not patched`: `working-set pull <id>`
records its fingerprint, then apply the plan again. The call exits non-zero
when any record did not apply.

**Pull first, or pin fingerprints.** A record that already exists and would
change is guarded by the version you wrote the plan against: its
`expected_fingerprint` in the plan, or else the fingerprint of its
`working-set pull` (`working-set pull <id>`, or the scope pull's member
file). With neither, apply refuses it before any write; it never reads a
fingerprint at run time. A record whose fingerprint moved since then stops
the whole call — another session edited it; pull it again and keep that edit
in the plan. New records need neither, so a plan of new records is one call.
After apply updates a record, its by-id pull snapshot moves to the
fingerprint the write returned, so the next apply from the same pull goes
through. Only the fingerprint moves: the snapshot's content is from before
the write, and the record's line says so — re-pull it before copying from
it. A scope pull's file is left as pulled — push diffs it, and a moved
fingerprint would let the next push revert the write — and the record's line
says to re-pull the scope.

Fallback, one record per call, each carrying the fingerprint the previous
write printed: `author epic <id> --title … --description …`, `author
requirement <id> --kind ur|sr --context … --title …`, `author update <id>
--expected-fingerprint … --description … --rationale … --boundary …
--verification-method …` (a UR's scenarios with `--criteria`), `author relate
<SR> --expected-fingerprint … --parent <UR>`, `author member <epic>
--expected-fingerprint … --member <id>…`.

### Take the scope

**Take the scope.**
`working-set select <EPIC|SR> --kind epic|single_sr [--members a,b] --phase plan [--lane defect]`
(`--lane defect` marks a customer-blocking defect: `process next`, `your-move`
and the session brief say so, and the defect-lane rules of `rdd-start` apply).
A take with no `--replaces` *adds* a holder — you may hold several pieces; name
the one you are displacing with `--replaces <piece> --outcome done|obsolete|returned=<phase>`.
Advance the phase later with `working-set select <scope> --phase <p>`.

### Author the packet

**Author the packet.** `working-set pull --scope` materializes
`.modernpath/working-set/<scope>/` — item files and `packet/*.md` sections —
under an authoring context. Edit, then `working-set push` (`--dry-run` first).
Until the push order is fixed in the tool: a member-record patch and its packet
sections may go in one push: item patches post first, and every filled section
the server then reports as stale is re-put unchanged so it carries the current
stamp — the push says `re-stamped N section(s)`, never "nothing to do"
(`--restamp` forces every filled canonical section). The scaffold reads the
required keys the server serves (`facts.sections.required`), so the stubs and
`process check --phase plan` walk one key set; a FAIL on `canonical_sections`
names the missing or stale keys. The fixed sections are `10-recon.md`
(reconnaissance), `15-state-inventory.md` (the state inventory — one row per
piece of state the change touches, or the one-line declaration that it
touches none; the stub names the columns), `30-red-strategy.md` and
`40-decisions.md`, plus `20-enrichment-<SR>.md` per selected system
requirement (SR-CLI-028-001).

### Approval file listing

**Approval file listing.** Before asking for human approval, present the brief
and list the related working-set files (`PROCESS.md` §Gates). Materialize a
selected scope with `working-set pull --scope`; pull named gates or items with
`working-set pull <id>…` as needed. Read the files and apply the currency checks
for the applicable file type and decision in `PROCESS.md` §Gates. Include the relevant scoped item
files, acceptance content, packet brief, decisions, findings, and evidence.
Resolve each listed file to its actual full absolute filesystem path and use
that path as both the visible Markdown link label and the target, followed by
a short description. Keep the links outside code formatting; use filesystem
paths rather than `file://` or editor-specific URIs. Wrap a target containing
spaces in angle brackets. Resolve missing or stale files before asking; never
invent paths. Full file contents are shown only when the human requests them.

### Cold review

**Cold review** runs from an independent context and records from it.
Delegate the pass to the installed reviewer, `.claude/agents/rdd-cold-reviewer.md`
(Read, Grep, Glob; no shell): it returns findings and a verdict as JSON, and
this session records them in one call.

1. `working-set pull --scope --for-review` — a read-only render that stamps a
   review context and the packet aggregate in `.context`, and writes the
   whole packet to one `REVIEW.md`: the aggregate header, the epic, the packet
   sections, the URs with their scenarios and the SRs with statement,
   rationale, boundary and verification method, each under an
   `id · fingerprint` heading, the members taken from the epic's stored
   membership. The reviewer reads that one file. Pushes from the review
   render are refused by design. The stamp also carries each record's and
   section's fingerprint (`reviewed: <key> <fingerprint>` lines).
   A later round adds `--since <previous CR-TRACE-…>`: `REVIEW.md` then holds
   the previous trace's code revision beside HEAD, what changed since that
   review in full, the open findings, the previous verdict, and the unchanged
   ids with their fingerprints only; the stamp and the trace still pin the
   full aggregate. It needs a previous trace recorded with reviewed
   fingerprints (one full round by this CLI first), is refused for a trace
   that is not this scope's cold review, and never takes the by-id narrow
   form.
2. The reviewer returns `{verdict, body, source, findings[], dispositions[]}`:
   a finding is `{id, category, severity, owner, source, body,
   introduced_by}`, a disposition `{id, from, disposition, ref, resolution,
   widens}` — a `RESOLVED` one names its `resolution`. Save it as
   `review.json`.
3. `process review record --file review.json` (`--scope`, or the held piece)
   records the new findings (ids already recorded are skipped), applies each
   disposition only while its finding is still in `from`, then records the
   cold-review trace `CR-TRACE-<scope>-<review context>` (`plan->entry`)
   naming the scope and each member, pinned to the aggregate the review pull
   stamped, with the stamped per-item fingerprints as
   `reviewed_fingerprints`. It refuses before any write without the review stamp, when the
   aggregate moved since the pull (re-pull `--for-review` and review again),
   or on a PASS that would leave a material finding `OPEN` or `DEFERRED`. A
   failure stops before the trace; a re-run records only what is missing.
4. `process check --phase cold_review` → `independent_verdict` and `findings`
   shows the checks when you need them.

Findings rules, whichever verb records them: both `category` and `severity`
are required (the CLI never defaults to the most blocking pair), and a
`note` severity never blocks whatever its category. Material categories are
`correctness`, `security`, `data_loss`, `contract`, `traceability`,
`testability`; a material finding left `OPEN` **or `DEFERRED`** fails the
check — an out-of-scope pre-existing finding is `REJECTED`, not deferred.
Findings are scope-scoped, not aggregate-scoped. `process findings list`
prints severity, per-round counts — including `widened` and `on earlier
resolutions` — and flags a round whose material findings are all
`traceability` (audit the change, not the document) or all on earlier
resolutions (the packet was reviewed incomplete: return it to `rdd-plan`);
`--all` groups rows and rounds per scope with a heading each, and `--json`
writes the rows and the per-scope rounds as one object (SR-CLI-027-004: a
convergence survey is one call). A `RESOLVED` disposition names its kind
(below), in a file as on the flags; a review file that breaks a resolution
rule is refused before any write.

By hand — one record per call, or on a CLI that lacks `review record`:

1. Read the full aggregate: `process next -v` → `full packet_fingerprint:`.
   The unadorned line is a 12-character display prefix that `--fingerprint`
   accepts and never matches.
2. Findings: `process findings add --scope <kind>:<id> --id <F-id> --category
   <c> --severity <s> --owner <o> --body … --aggregate <full aggregate>`, or a
   whole list with `process findings add --file findings.json` (a JSON array
   of `{id, scope, category, severity, owner, source, body, introduced_by}`,
   each pinned to its own scope's aggregate). `--introduced-by <F-id>` (the
   file's `introduced_by`) names the earlier finding of the same scope whose
   resolution introduced the mechanism this one faults (SR-CLI-027-003).
   Dispositions: `process findings disposition --id <F-id> --disposition
   RESOLVED|DEFERRED|REJECTED --scope <kind>:<id> --from <what you saw>` —
   the CLI reads the finding's fingerprint for the scope, and
   `--expected-fingerprint` from `process findings list` still works — or
   several with `process findings disposition --file dispositions.json`
   (`{id, scope, from, disposition, ref, resolution, widens}`, each written
   only while its finding is still in `from`). No flag resolves every open
   finding: a disposition names its finding.
   A `RESOLVED` names how it resolved (SR-CLI-027-001): `--resolution
   packet-edit` (the packet was clarified), `scope` (a scope action; `--ref`
   names its record) or `decision` (`--ref` is its `USER:` source) — the
   file's `resolution` takes the same values and a review file's
   dispositions carry it too; the list prints `RESOLVED/<kind>`. A packet
   edit does not change a member: the server refuses a `packet-edit` whose
   scoped member changed since the finding was raised, unless `--widens
   USER:<date>:<why>` (the file's `widens`) states the widening on the
   human's word (SR-CLI-027-002; `-v` prints it). A finding already
   `RESOLVED` changes only its reference: `--ref --expected-fingerprint …`
   with no `--disposition`.
3. Verdict: `author trace CR-TRACE-<scope>-R<n> --purpose cold-review
   --verdict PASS|FAIL --scope <epic> --scope <each member> --source …
   --title …`. The pin defaults to the scope's current packet aggregate and
   the transition to `plan->entry` (REQ-CROSS-376/377); a given
   `--fingerprint` must be the full 64-character hash of the right class (a
   display prefix or a content hash is refused by name; a full hash matching
   nothing is recorded with a warning), and a transition is `--from`/`--to`
   or one quoted `--transition FROM->TO` — a fragment is refused before any
   write. The trace inherits the review context the scope was pulled under; a
   verdict with no review context is refused, and one recorded from an
   authoring context reads as not independent.
4. `process check --phase cold_review` → `independent_verdict` and `findings`.

### Entry

**Entry.** `modernpath process enter <scope>` does the ceremony from the store
facts: it refuses naming the fact when no independent passing cold-review
trace exists at the current aggregate, when a packet section is missing,
when the `entry_brief` packet section is absent or incomplete, or when
`ENTRY-<scope>` is open or answered (answer or apply it); otherwise it opens
the gate naming the epic plus every member still in FROM (a single SR names
itself), the cold-review trace as prerequisite and `PROPOSED->TODO`, and
moves the selection to phase `entry`. A section whose content is unchanged
but whose scope context moved — a record edit moves it — is not refused:
once the cold review passes, the verb re-puts it with its served content
under its served fingerprint (a concurrent edit conflicts), re-reads, and
refuses only the sections still missing, by name. `--dry-run` prints the
plan and names the sections it would re-stamp, writing nothing. It
also refuses on reconnaissance drift (SR-CLI-028-002): the selection must
carry the revision the packet was reconnoitred at (`working-set select
<scope> --recon-revision <sha>`; absent, the verb refuses before the facts
read); it fetches the remote default branch (`--no-fetch` for offline
fixtures only) and, when the tip moved past that revision and a path the
packet cites as `CODE:`/`TEST:` changed from the merge-base to the tip,
refuses naming the tip and the paths — a packet reconnoitred on a branch
ahead of main is current, not drift. Re-reconnoitre and re-select with the
new revision, or, on the human's word, `--allow-drift USER:<date>:<why>`
records the source, the tip and the paths on the gate body; in a two-call
entry both calls run the check and take the flag. The brief is
the `packet/entry_brief.md` section in the PROCESS.md brief shape (`- What:`,
`- Why now:`, `- Changes if approved:`, `- Risk if wrong:`,
`- Recommendation:`; every bullet required), or `--brief-file` with a JSON
brief object or the same markdown bullets.

*As-built members first.* An epic whose members split between PROPOSED and
PENDING_VERIFICATION enters in two calls: the first opens
`ENTRY-<scope>-VERIFY` (`PENDING_VERIFICATION->TODO`) naming the as-built
members only, pinned at the epic's packet aggregate so the epic's cold review
is its prerequisite — the store admits it for a still-PROPOSED epic on that
passing review — and says which members and the epic enter next; once those
members are `TODO`, the second call opens `ENTRY-<scope>` as usual. An epic
already entered (`TODO`, `READY`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `IN_REVIEW`) with as-built
members gets the verification gate alone, answerable in Mission Control or
with `factory answer`; a `DONE` or `OBSOLETE` epic is refused (demote or
reopen it first). A member entered through its own members-only gate is
re-pinned after a packet move with `process reapply-entry <member>` and
re-entered with `process reenter <member>`, which reads the piece that holds
it.

*Successor ids.* When `ENTRY-<scope>` (or `-VERIFY`) is already closed or
withdrawn — a scope demoted to PROPOSED and re-planned — the verb derives the
next free `ENTRY-<scope>-R2`, `-R3`… and names the closed predecessor in the
gate body; `--gate-id` overrides the id only — an open or answered id is
never rotated past.

By hand — when the verb refuses for a fact you must record first, or on a
CLI or server that lacks it — record the entry trace (`author trace
ENTRY-TRACE-<scope> --purpose entry --verdict PASS --scope … --prerequisite
CR-TRACE-<scope>-R<n>`; the pin defaults to the packet aggregate), then open
the gate **naming the cold-review trace**:

```
modernpath author gate ENTRY-<scope> --purpose entry --gate-kind approval_request \
  --transition "PROPOSED->TODO" --scope <epic> --scope <each member> \
  --prerequisite CR-TRACE-<scope>-R<n> --prerequisite ENTRY-TRACE-<scope> \
  --option approve="Approve entry" --recommended-option approve --brief-file brief.json
```

Trace **before** gate: the gate is refused unless a named prerequisite is a
passing cold-review trace pinned to the current aggregate, and a gate cannot be
edited after birth. The gate scope is the epic plus **every member not yet
entered** — the server refuses a gate that names the epic but omits one — or
the single requirement; several items with no epic cannot be pinned. Members
of an epic that is already `TODO` are recovered by a members-only entry gate
naming them (its prerequisite is the epic's cold-review trace). Move the
selection: `working-set select <scope> --phase entry`.

### Answer, then apply

**Answer, then apply.** The human answers in Mission Control or with
`factory answer ENTRY-<scope> --options approve` (a human decision; the CLI
attaches the review a governed gate needs). Answering records; it moves
nothing. Apply in one call:

```
modernpath author advance --gate ENTRY-<scope>
```

It reads the gate — its fingerprint, the FROM and TO of its transition, and
an `approve` answer when the chosen options are exactly `approve` (any other
answer is echoed with `--gate-answer`) — then advances every record the
gate's exact scope names that is still in FROM, members first, then the
epic; it prints each result, skips a record already past, and stops before
the epic when a member is refused. `--expected` is always the gate's FROM
state, never a fresh read. The gate closes and reads `applied` once every
named transition has landed.

Fallback, one record per call, members first, then the epic:

```
modernpath author advance <member> --kind requirement --to TODO --expected PROPOSED \
  --gate ENTRY-<scope> --gate-answer approve --gate-fingerprint <gate Fingerprint>
modernpath author advance <epic> --kind epic --to TODO --expected PROPOSED --gate … 
```

`--gate-fingerprint` is the gate's content-shadow hash — the `Fingerprint:`
line of `working-set pull ENTRY-<scope>`, or `fingerprint` in `factory gates
ENTRY-<scope> --json`; `author advance <id> --gate <GATE>` also reads it, and
the FROM, TO and kind, when they are omitted. `--gate-answer` accepts the
option key, its label, or the stored answer text.

The entry pass ends here: report the applied transitions and stop. The answer
was a decision about the gate, not an instruction to build (`PROCESS.md`
§Gates); §2 begins in a session the human opens for the build.

## 2. Build → evidence → completion → apply (store-backed)

The operator records evidence; the tool does the ceremony (EPIC-CLI-017).

1. `working-set select <scope> --phase build`.
2. **Evidence**, in one call: `factory evidence --file runs.json`, a JSON
   array with one run per entry, `{pass, fail, skip, role, revision, kind,
   log, totals}` — each SR's RED entry `{"fail": ["<SR>"], "role": "RED",
   "revision": "<red-commit>", "log": "<command>"}` and its passing entry
   `{"pass": ["<SR>"], "log": "<command>"}`. Each run is posted on its own
   with an id derived from the whole entry, so running the same file again
   updates the same runs and records any that failed; a refused run is
   reported and the rest continue.

   Single-record fallback — **RED**, recorded at the RED commit: `factory
   evidence --fail <SR> --role RED --kind local_test --log "<command>"`, or
   later with `--revision <red-commit>` (no checkout); **GREEN**: `factory
   evidence --pass <SR> --kind local_test --log "<command>"`. Evidence
   currency is role-aware: a RED never shadows a passing result, and the
   server warns at record time about a pass with no RED before it or a RED
   recorded after a pass.
3. **Advance**, in one call: `process advance --all --piece <EPIC> --log "<command>"`
   runs the per-SR advance below for every system requirement of the piece,
   prints each SR it moved and, for each one it did not, the refusal that
   names why; it exits non-zero when any SR was not advanced, and the ones
   that were stay moved.
4. **Advance one SR**: `modernpath process advance <SR> --log "<command>"` reads the
   facts of the piece that holds the SR (`--piece` when you hold several),
   refuses naming the fact (no RED recorded, evidence failing/claimed/stale,
   the SR not a member, no delivery facts served), records
   `TRACE-LOWER-<SR>` at the SR's content hash and reconciles until nothing
   remains — `TODO->IN_PROGRESS->IN_REVIEW` for the SR and the epic's own
   step. A second call reports nothing to do. Sibling transitions and FAILs
   are information; a FAIL naming the SR fails the verb.

   By hand: `author trace TRACE-LOWER-<SR> --purpose lower --scope <SR>
   --verdict PASS` (the pin defaults to the SR's content hash — the
   `Fingerprint:` line of `working-set pull <SR>`, never the aggregate or the
   git revision; the transition defaults to `build->verify`), then `process
   reconcile --apply` twice. An epic is held at `IN_PROGRESS` while any member
   carries a `STALE` member-scoped cold-review trace with no newer pass at
   member scope: re-record the member-scoped trace at the aggregate the pass
   reviewed, saying in its body that it reflects that review.
5. **Deliver** through the project's integration path, then check out the
   merged revision: completion runs at the **delivered revision**, the tip
   of the remote default branch.
6. **Complete**: `modernpath process complete <scope> --log "<ci run>"
   [--body "<audit and disclosures>"]` fetches the default branch and refuses
   unless HEAD is its tip (behind, or not on the branch, is named), refuses a
   member not `IN_REVIEW` (`process advance` it) or an epic not `IN_REVIEW`
   that was never completed before (`process reconcile --apply` folds it),
   then records one `ci` run at HEAD naming the epic, its user requirement
   and every member this completion moves (a `DONE` sibling an earlier
   completion accepted keeps its CURRENT evidence and is never re-posted),
   records `COMPLETE-TRACE-<scope>` PASS at the packet aggregate
   naming every `IN_REVIEW`/`DONE` member, opens `COMPLETE-<scope>` naming
   that trace and the epic plus every member still `IN_REVIEW` (`OBSOLETE`
   and `DEFERRED` members are excluded and disclosed), with the brief from
   `packet/completion_brief.md` (or `--brief-file`), and moves the selection
   to phase `completion`. `--dry-run` prints the plan. A reopened epic —
   `IN_PROGRESS` after a defect demotion, every member back in `IN_REVIEW` or
   `DONE`, its earlier `COMPLETE-<scope>` closed — completes in the same
   call: the successor trace `COMPLETE-TRACE-<scope>-R2` is recorded,
   reconcile folds the epic to `IN_REVIEW`, and `COMPLETE-<scope>-R2` opens
   naming the predecessor; a rebuild that moved the packet aggregate under
   the applied entry approval is refused naming `process reapply-entry`.
   The epic's user requirement is a member the facts serve, so the run, the
   trace and the gate name the epic and its user requirement `UR-<epic>`
   (`UR-<suffix>` for `EPIC-<suffix>`) while it is `IN_REVIEW`; it reaches
   `IN_REVIEW` through its upper trace by hand (`author trace TRACE-UPPER-<UR>
   --purpose upper --scope <UR> --verdict PASS` — like `lower`, an upper trace
   reads its pin from the store, the UR's own content hash, and infers
   `build->verify`; name `--fingerprint`/`--from`/`--to` only to override) and
   `process reconcile --apply` — `process advance` takes an SR. `working-set pull <epic>` lists only the SRs under
    **Members** — pull the UR by id to read its state.

   By hand, in this order: `factory evidence --pass <epic>,<UR>,<member>,…
   --kind ci --log "<run>"` (an epic or UR with no posted passing run of its
   own reads `:claimed` and the gate refuses with "not yet"); `author trace
   COMPLETE-TRACE-<scope> --purpose completion --verdict PASS --scope <epic>
   --scope <each member> --body …` (pin defaults to the aggregate, transition
   to `IN_REVIEW->DONE`); then the gate naming it, scoped to the epic, every
   SR member not yet `DONE` and the UR while it is `IN_REVIEW` — a gate that
   omits one is refused with `exact_scope: completion gate names <epic> but omits
    members not yet DONE: <ids>`:

```
modernpath author gate COMPLETE-<scope> --purpose completion --gate-kind approval_request \
  --scope <epic> --scope <each member> \
  --prerequisite COMPLETE-TRACE-<scope> --option approve="Approve completion" \
  --recommended-option approve --brief-file brief.json
```

7. The human answers (Mission Control, or `factory answer COMPLETE-<scope>
   --options approve --text "USER:<date>: …"`).
8. **Apply** in one call: `author advance --gate COMPLETE-<scope>` — every SR,
   the UR, then the epic. Fallback, members first: `author advance <member>
   --kind requirement --to DONE --expected IN_REVIEW --gate COMPLETE-<scope>
   --gate-answer approve --gate-fingerprint <gate Fingerprint>` for every SR, then the UR (also
    `--kind requirement`), then the epic with `--kind epic`.
9. `working-set select <scope> --put-down --outcome done`; `process next` now
   reads complete or "no current selection".

### Retiring a gate that cannot be approved

A governed gate born with no prerequisite trace, or pinned under an aggregate
that has since moved, is unapprovable, and a gate id is opened once. Retire it
by superseding it with one that can pass:

1. Hold the piece: `working-set select <epic> --kind epic --phase completion`.
2. Read the **current** aggregate: `process check --phase completion -v --piece
   <epic>` prints `full packet_fingerprint:`. `process next -v` may answer
   `no route derived — entry_origin_unavailable` — a member whose evidence is
   not current has no live entry origin — and it still prints the aggregate.
3. Record the completion trace at that aggregate (step 9), then open the
   successor naming both: `author gate COMPLETE-<scope>-2 … --prerequisite
   COMPLETE-TRACE-<scope> --supersedes COMPLETE-<scope>`. The old gate reads
   `superseded` in `factory gates <id>`; the new one carries the link.
4. Park the piece while the human answers, so your other held pieces stay
   unambiguous: `working-set select <epic> --suspend --reason "awaiting the
   completion answer" --waiting-on COMPLETE-<scope>-2`.
5. On the answer: `working-set select <epic> --resume`, `author advance` the
   SRs, the UR, then the epic (step 12), and `--put-down --outcome done`.

### Reopening a delivered item

A shipped requirement that turns out defective, or whose decision is
reversed, is sent back with one attributable decision — never a duplicate
requirement, a hand-edited status or a synthetic failure (`PROCESS.md`
§Attributable demotions):

1. `author demote <id> --to IN_PROGRESS --basis defect --reason "USER:<date>:<why>"`
   (or `--to PROPOSED --basis reversed-decision`; `--to OBSOLETE --basis
   superseded --superseded-by <new id>`). It reads the item's status (only
   `IN_REVIEW` or `DONE` is demoted), refuses locally without a `USER:`
   reason or with a basis that does not match the destination, and opens
   `DEMOTE-<id>`: purpose `demotion`, no prerequisite trace — an
   attributable decision, not a fingerprint check, so it stays answerable
   after the packet moves. A delegated agent is denied the verb.
2. The human answers (Mission Control, or `factory answer DEMOTE-<id>
   --options approve --text "USER:<date>: …"`).
3. `author demote <id> --apply` advances the item on the gate with the triple
   read from the store. The server invalidates by basis — a defect stales
   the item's own evidence, lower trace and the completion traces and leaves
   the epic's cold review and the user requirement's upper validation
   standing; a reversed decision stales the plan too. Only a reversed
   decision retires the item's own entry inside the shared entry gate
   (siblings keep theirs). Whatever the basis, the apply moves the user
   requirement and the owning epic that were `IN_REVIEW`/`DONE` on the same
   gate (the epic to `PROPOSED` for a reversed decision, else
   `IN_PROGRESS`); the verb prints them as `followed:` lines.

Several items reopened by one decision take one gate:
`author demote --ids A,B,C …` (or `--file`, one id per line). All items must
be `IN_REVIEW`, or all `DONE` — a mixed batch is refused before any write,
naming both groups; run the group holding user requirements first. The gate
is `DEMOTE-<first id>`, or the next free `-R<n>` when the earlier gates in
the series are closed or withdrawn (an open or answered one is refused and
named); the printed hint names it. After the answer,
`author demote --gate-id <gate> --apply` advances every item, user
requirements first, skipping an item already applied; an item another gate's
follow already moved is reported with that gate and passed over, and the
output names `author gate-withdraw <gate>` for the gate that then cannot
close. Any other refusal stops the run, lists what was applied and what
remains, and exits non-zero — re-run the same command to resume.
`author demote <id> --apply` without `--gate-id` applies the newest gate in
the `DEMOTE-<id>` series, every item on it.
4. Next: a defect is rebuilt red-first, `process advance` returns it to
   `IN_REVIEW` on its lower trace — with no re-entry, even when no entry
   gate names it (an epic entered through a legacy approval gate) — and
   `process complete` re-completes the epic on the siblings' current
   evidence (§2 step 6); a reversed
   decision is re-planned and cold-reviewed, and `process enter` opens the
   successor entry gate `ENTRY-<scope>-R2` (§1 Entry).

### The small-change lane (store-backed)

One small change — one SR in no epic, a class a current lane authorization
covers, at most five non-test source files and no excluded area — goes
through the lane (`PROCESS.md` §Small-change lane) instead of epic or
single-SR scope. The authorization is the human decision; the server checks
every stand-in for the per-change answer and refuses by name.

- **Authorize, once per System:** `process lane authorize --classes <c,…>
  --appliers <user id,…> --expires <date> --cap <n> [--exclude <glob>]…`
  (or `--file lane.json`) opens the gate and prints its id. **A workspace
  admin answers it once: in the web app (Mission Control), or with `process
  lane approve <gate> [--text "<decision>"]`** — one call to the server's
  `lane_approve` action, answered as the signed-in user (never an actor named
  in the request), refused before any write when the gate is not a
  `lane_authorization`. `factory answer` on it is refused, and so is any
  other client (an API, integration or MCP token). `lane approve` asks in the
  kit and the subagent guard denies it: the decision is the human's, made in
  the conversation. `process lane` (no subcommand) shows the current
  authorization.

The verb sequence for one small change, five writing calls and one read:

1. `author apply --file sr.yaml` — the SR with its statement, boundary,
   verification method, `lane_class` (`defect_with_failing_test`, `wording`,
   `presentation`, `dependency_patch`) and `sources: [USER:…]`; the lane
   enters only a sourced SR, and the class is set **before** the review,
   which pins it (`author update <SR> --lane-class <class>` to set it alone).
2. `working-set pull <SR> --for-review` — a read: renders the SR to
   `.modernpath/working-set/<SR>/REVIEW.md` under a fresh review context,
   stamping the SR's content fingerprint and packet sections. The delegated
   reviewer reads that file and returns the usual review JSON.
3. `process lane review <SR> --file review.json` — one narrow pass, no
   rounds. It refuses before any write without the stamp, without a
   `lane_class`, or when the SR changed since the pull; it holds the SR as a
   `single_sr` piece (the single-SR aggregate is served only for a held
   piece), then records `LANE-REVIEW-<SR>-<context>`: a cold-review trace on
   `PROPOSED->TODO` at the SR's single-SR aggregate, with the review context
   and a `LANE:narrow` source. A FAIL is recorded and the change leaves the
   lane for single-SR scope.
4. `process lane enter <SR>` — reads the narrow review and the newest
   answered authorization, then posts one advance `PROPOSED->TODO` with
   `lane_ref` and no `gate_ref`; the server checks currency, class, the
   signed-in applier, the daily cap and the review's independence. On an
   entered SR that changed afterwards (TODO through IN_REVIEW) it posts
   `lane_reapply` instead — review the changed SR again first.
5. Build red-first, then `factory evidence --file runs.json` (RED, then the
   passing run).
6. `process advance --all --piece <SR> --log "<command>"` — to IN_REVIEW.

After delivery to the default branch:

- `process lane check <SR> --commit <sha> [--base <sha>]` posts `git diff
  --name-only` over `<sha>^1..<sha>` (a merge or squash commit) or
  `<base>..<sha>` (a rebase delivery). It refuses a commit the default
  branch does not reach and a base that is not the commit's ancestor. The
  server has no repository access: it records the SR's delivered revision
  and the lane-eligibility trace as its own verdict over the file list the
  CLI reported, and says so. The first full report for a commit counts — a
  later one for the same commit that leaves a file out or uses another base
  is refused; a new commit may be reported. A DONE or OBSOLETE SR is refused.
  A FAIL names each offending file, exits non-zero, and the change leaves
  the lane.
- `process lane complete --log "<ci run>"` takes every IN_REVIEW small change
  with a passing eligibility at its delivered revision, records the run you
  name as the run the agent reported (nothing verifies it, and the brief
  says so) and `LANE-COMPLETE-TRACE-<SR>` at its single-SR aggregate,
  and opens one `LANE-BATCH-<date>` gate: options `approve` and
  `reject:<SR>` per member, each change's files in the brief. It lists the
  small changes left out and why. `--dry-run` prints the batch.
- The human answers it (web app, or `factory answer <id> --options
  approve,reject:<SR>`): the answer approves every member not rejected.
- `process lane complete --apply [--gate <id>]` advances each approved member
  `IN_REVIEW->DONE`; a rejected one stays IN_REVIEW, to be fixed and batched
  again. Once answered, the batch is pinned to its approved members only, so
  fixing a rejected change never blocks the approved ones.

A lane SR never completes through an ordinary completion gate unless it
re-entered with a full packet and review.

## 3. The work-selection model (store-backed)

- **One holder per piece; several pieces per person.** The constraint stops
  two people taking the same work and does nothing else. A take of a piece
  someone else holds is refused naming the holder; a suspended piece is
  claimable by anyone.
- **`--piece <scope>`** on `working-set` and `process` names which of your
  current pieces a read or write resolves. With several held and none named,
  `process next` prints one block per held piece — its scope, phase, why,
  the skill to run and the gates waiting on it — names the `--piece` remedy
  and exits 0, so session entry is one call; every other scoped read and
  write is refused by name — `process check`, `process reconcile` and
  `process advance` print "you hold several current pieces (2): A, B — name
  one with --piece <id>", the server answers 409, and `factory status` lists
  what you hold; "no current selection" is printed only when you hold none.
  Name the piece.
- **Suspend / resume / claim / put down:** `working-set select <scope>
  --suspend --reason … [--target … --waiting-on …]`; `--resume <scope>`;
  a fresh take of a suspended scope claims it; `--put-down --outcome
  done|obsolete|returned=<phase>` closes it. Only a piece you currently hold
  can be suspended: to change a parked piece's reason, resume it first; the
  earlier reason stays on the closed row.
- **Re-read the selection immediately before mutating it.** A stale snapshot
  has displaced a colleague's live selection and closed it with the default
  outcome. `working-set check` reports stale files; `--refresh` re-pulls.
- The selection is caller-scoped: reads and writes resolve against the
  authenticated person's pieces, never a colleague's.

## 4. The fingerprint model (store-backed)

Three pins, one per trace class, named the same way everywhere: the
**packet aggregate**, the **content hash**, the **process revision**.
`author trace` reads the right one from the store when `--fingerprint` is
omitted and refuses a display prefix or the wrong class by name
(REQ-CROSS-376); the ceremony verbs never take one. Passing a wrong one by
hand records a trace that never matches and can never be removed.

| Trace | Pin to | Read it from |
|---|---|---|
| lower (an SR's `LOWER-<SR>`) | the SR's content fingerprint (its sync shadow) | `Fingerprint:` in `working-set pull <SR>` |
| cold-review, entry, completion | the packet **aggregate** of the scope | `full packet_fingerprint:` under `process next -v` / `process check … -v` |
| evidence (`factory evidence`) | the git revision | pinned to `HEAD` at record time |

A **human gate** has its own content-shadow hash (`Fingerprint:` in
`working-set pull <gate>`) — that is what `author advance --gate-fingerprint`
and `author update --expected-fingerprint` echo, and what a stale copy makes
conflict instead of overwrite.

What moves what:

- The **aggregate** folds the scope's member records and packet sections. It
  does not move on lifecycle changes or on git HEAD. Editing a **member
  record** moves the scope context and thereby the stamp on every sibling
  packet section; each section is re-stamped only by pushing changed content.
  Prefer editing a packet section over a member record when a fix can live in
  either.
- A packet section is stamped for its **own** scope's context, so a section on
  a member is judged against that member, not the ambient selection.
- A decision gate is pinned to the subject it **names**: an epic plus items
  pins to the epic; a single item to that item; several items with no epic is
  refused.
- Re-pulling `--scope` rotates the authoring context; the review context is
  stamped by `--for-review` and inherited by the cold-review trace.

## 5. Refusal glossary

`origin: cli` strings are printed by this binary; `origin: server` strings
arrive as `server <code>: <message>` or verbatim from a 422.

| Refusal (substring) | Origin | Cause | Clears it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `no current work selection — \`working-set select\` a scope first` | cli | a scope read or push with no selection | `working-set select <scope>` |
| `no current selection — nothing to route` | cli | no current piece is held (with several held, `process next` prints one block per piece instead) | `working-set select <scope>` |
| `you hold several current pieces (…): … — name one with --piece <id>` | cli | a scoped read or write other than `process next` — `process check`, `process reconcile`, `process advance` — under several held pieces, none named | `--piece <scope>` on the command |
| `push: re-stamped %d section(s) whose scope context moved` | cli | unchanged sections the server reported stale were re-put for a fresh stamp (not an error) | nothing |
| `no current selection named %s is held by you` | cli | `working-set pull selection --piece X` for a piece you do not hold; the snapshot is left unchanged | name a held piece |
| `no route derived — <reason>` | cli | `process next` on a live selection with no phase to route — `entry_origin_unavailable` when a member whose evidence is not current has no live entry origin, retired by a demotion or never entered (a scope whose evidence is all current routes to `complete` instead); not an error, and `-v` still prints the aggregate | `process reenter <member-id>` re-establishes that MEMBER's entry (fresh cold review + human approval) — the entry origin is the member's fact, so naming the scope resolves a different gate; `process check --phase build` names the members. For any other reason nothing — read the aggregate from it or from `process check --phase completion -v` |
| `you hold several current selections (…) — name one with ?scope=<id>` | server | an unscoped scope read or write under several pieces | `--piece <scope>` on the command; `process advance` and `process reenter` on an SR that is itself one of the held pieces resolve it without one |
| `is already held by` | server | a take of a piece someone else holds | take a different piece, or wait for a put-down |
| `closing … requires stating how it ended` | server | a put-down or displacement with no outcome | add `--outcome done\|obsolete\|returned=<phase>` |

| `--from is required with --scope` | cli | `process findings disposition --scope` without the disposition you saw; nothing was written | add `--from OPEN` (or the disposition you read) |
| `someone changed it after you read it` | cli | `process findings disposition --scope --from` on a finding no longer in `--from`; nothing was written | read `process findings list` again and decide |
| `has unknown key(s)` | cli | a findings, dispositions, review or lane authorization file with a key the shape does not know (a misspelling); every one is named and nothing was written | correct the named keys |
| `problem(s) in the plan; nothing was written` | cli | `author apply` where a record is invalid, would change with neither a pinned `expected_fingerprint` nor a `working-set pull`, or moved since that fingerprint; each is named | fix the named record; for a guard, `working-set pull <id>` (keep any other change in the plan) or pin its `expected_fingerprint`, and run it again |
| `conflicted — the store moved since the fingerprint the plan guarded on` | cli | `author apply` whose patch the store refused as stale between the check and the write | `working-set pull <id>`, keep the other change in the plan, run it again |

| `moved since the review pull (stamped …, now …)` | cli | `process review record` after the packet aggregate changed; nothing was written | re-pull `--for-review` and review again |
| `the verdict is PASS, but material finding(s) would stay OPEN or DEFERRED on …` | cli | a PASS review file that leaves a material finding open; nothing was written | resolve or reject it in the file's `dispositions`, or record the verdict as FAIL |
| `the run stopped there.` | cli | `author apply` where the store refused a write (not a 409) after the plan checked; the refusal, the records written, any created but not patched, and those not written are named | `working-set pull <id>` for each record created but not patched, fix the refused record, then apply the plan again — written records read `unchanged` |

| `carries no FROM->TO transition — pass --to and --expected with the record id` | cli | `author advance --gate` on a gate that holds no transition | name the record with `--to` and `--expected` |
| `did not advance — ` | cli | `author advance --gate` where a member the gate names is neither in the FROM state nor already past it (or is missing); the members that could move did, the epic did not | move the named members to the FROM state, then run the same command again |
| `packet sections missing or stale for …` | cli | `process enter` on sections still missing after it re-stamped the unchanged ones | author them and `working-set push` |
| `a … finding is immutable except its reference — a reopen or content edit is refused` | server | editing a settled finding | record a new finding |
| `--resolution is required on RESOLVED` / `resolution_kind: is required on a RESOLVED disposition` | cli / server | a `RESOLVED` without its kind | `--resolution packet-edit\|scope\|decision`; `scope` needs `--ref <record>`, `decision` needs `--ref USER:…` |
| `--disposition is required … or --ref alone to change the reference of a finding already RESOLVED` | cli | neither a disposition nor a reference | name the disposition, or `--ref` alone on a settled finding |
| `changed since … was raised — a packet edit does not change a member` | server | a `packet_edit` resolution after a scoped member's content moved | resolve it as `scope` or `decision`, or `--widens USER:<date>:<why>` |
| `--widens names the human who accepted the widening …` | cli | a `--widens` without `USER:` (a `--widens` with a resolution other than `packet-edit` is refused the same way) | `--widens USER:<date>:<why>` with `--resolution packet-edit` |

| `does not exist` (`gate <id> does not exist`) | cli | `factory gates <id>` on an id the store does not hold — a mistyped id, or a gate the store never wrote (the active release's `GATE-RELEASE-<slug>` when the release was activated from another system, or before the activation wrote it) | check the id in `your-move --queue` or the epic pull; for the release, `factory status` and `SELECTION.md` name the gate or say `no recorded selection gate on this system` — run `factory release activate <slug> --source USER:…` here to record one |

## Reverse-engineering onboarding (store-backed)

Use this sequence with `rdd-reverse-engineer`; these operations are separate
from delivery entry/completion gates. Run them only in the main session.

Before resuming, use `modernpath reverse-engineer status --run ID` to recover
stored authorization, source identities and group receipts. Reuse unchanged
inputs/keys and reconcile acknowledged groups with the unpublished remainder;
do not repeat mode approval or recapture completed sources. Resume incomplete
captures as needed. A conflict requires reconciliation, not another key. New
runs follow the sequence below.

1. `modernpath factory status` verifies the authenticated system binding.
   `modernpath process prepare-inputs` reports local/server document freshness
   without refreshing. Search/read fresh local documents first; use
   `modernpath docs sync` only for missing or stale exports. Use live search/read
   for material missing locally or when a current authoritative answer is needed.
2. `modernpath reverse-engineer inventory --repository key=/absolute/root`
   (repeat the `--repository` flag in one command for each repository;
   one run has one inventory file) emits frozen paths, hashes, sizes, revision,
   dirty state and exclusions. Non-Git directories and Git worktrees are supported.
   A tracked symbolic link in a Git repository is left out and listed as an
   exclusion; it is never followed.
   For part of a large Git repository, add `--path key=relative/path`
   (repeatable) for the directories or files to include. The inventory then
   holds only those files; the revision and dirty state stay the whole
   repository's, the 32,000,000-byte and file limits count the included files,
   and every file left out is an exclusion with the reason `outside the
   authorized scope`; a directory left out whole is one `subtree` entry, and
   Git-ignored files under it are not listed again. A path is a literal name —
   no patterns, no trailing slash — and a non-Git root cannot be scoped. Name
   the tests with the code they cover: one proof takes one delivery report per
   repository, and every cited code and test file must come from the same
   capture. A path is only a set of files; which domain or capability it holds
   is for the person naming it to decide. A subfolder given as
   the repository root is not a substitute: it inventories as unversioned and
   dirty, so its requirements cannot be accepted as built.
   Save the output unchanged when you run it: add `> inventory.json` to the
   command. A large inventory does not belong in your context; read from the
   file only the totals (`file_count`, `byte_count`) and, for each entry of
   `repositories`, its `key`, `revision`, `dirty` and how many `files` and
   `exclusions` it has.
   The saved file must hold the bytes the command printed. In bash, zsh and
   `cmd` the redirect does that. In PowerShell it does not: PowerShell's own
   redirect re-encodes the output. In PowerShell, let `cmd` save
   `inventory.json` and `preflight.json`, for example
   `cmd /c "modernpath reverse-engineer preflight > preflight.json"`.
   If step 4 refuses a saved file as invalid JSON, or because its snapshot
   digest does not match, the file was re-encoded when it was saved: save it
   again this way and never edit it. `run.json` in step 4 is not read back by
   the CLI and needs no such care.
3. `modernpath reverse-engineer preflight > preflight.json` saves, under
   `data`, the existing-corpus fingerprint, the requirement count, the
   recommended mode and the document descriptors. The recommendation is not
   authorization: the person chooses **baseline** or **derived** in the one
   question of step 4.
4. Authorize from the two saved files. Do not write a JSON file, and
   do not run `inventory` or `preflight` again, except after a refusal as
   described below: the saved files are what the person approves. After the
   person has answered:
   `modernpath reverse-engineer authorize --inventory inventory.json
   --preflight preflight.json --mode baseline --source "USER:<date>:<name>
   approved <mode>, documents <all|none>" --key <run name>
   --documents all > run.json`.
   Every flag is required and none has a default. The mode and the document
   choice are the person's answers. You propose the run name for `--key` — short
   and stable, for example `billing-baseline` — and you write `--source` from
   the answer, in at most 255 bytes. `<name>` is the person who answered; ask
   for it in the same question when you do not know it. The response is the
   whole run, with every file and every attached document, so it goes to
   `run.json`: read only `data.id` from that file for step 5. Actor, system,
   Base and process revision are server-owned.

   **Before authorizing, show the person** what they approve, read from the
   two files, in plain words and in one message:
   - the source: each repository with its commit and whether it is clean
     (`repositories[].revision`, `repositories[].dirty`), how many files and
     megabytes are included (`file_count`, `byte_count`), and how many
     entries are left out (`repositories[].exclusions`; the field is absent
     when nothing is left out);
   - the mode and what it means: baseline publishes as-built requirements as
     "Baselined — not verified"; derived proposes candidates for later review.
     State how many requirements the system already has
     (`data.requirement_count`) and `data.recommended_mode` as a
     recommendation, never as the answer;
   - the analysis documents: how many the preflight lists (`data.documents`)
     and what attaching them does — the run's requirements can then cite
     them; without them requirements cite code and tests only. Recommend
     `--documents all` when `data.documents_truncated` is false. When it is
     true, the system has more documents than one run can attach and `all`
     cannot be authorized from the saved files: say so and offer `none` only.
     The person still answers;
   - the run name. You propose the run name; the person can change it.
   Ask once: one question that covers the mode, the documents and the run
   name. Then run the command with what the person said.

   **If the authorization is refused**, nothing was recorded, and the same run
   name can be used again. A refusal never lets you change the mode, the
   document choice or the run name yourself. The two rules below are for
   these three server reasons only:
   - `stale_corpus` (the requirements changed) or `document_not_authorized`
     (a document changed): run `preflight` again and save it as
     `preflight-new.json`. Then compare the four fields of the two files:
     `data.requirement_count`, `data.recommended_mode`, the number of
     `data.documents` and `data.documents_truncated`. If nothing differs,
     authorize again with the same answers and `--preflight
     preflight-new.json`, and tell the person that you did. If something
     differs, show the difference and ask again before you authorize.
   - `document_snapshot_too_large` (too much document text for one run): stop
     and tell the person. The error and the help name `--documents none` as
     the next step; that is the mechanism, not permission. `--documents none`
     changes what they approved, so authorize with it only after they agree,
     and write the new choice into `--source`.
   If the same refusal comes a second time, or the refusal is any other
   reason — for example `idempotency_conflict`, which means the run name
   already belongs to a run with other content — stop and show the person the
   error. The same holds when the command itself refuses your flags.
   The source list in `inventory.json` is not part of these refusals and
   needs no new review.

   A file built another way can still be given with `authorize --file
   authorization.json`. Its fields are `key`, `mode`, `authorization_source`,
   `corpus_fingerprint`, `repositories` (from inventory) and `documents` (from
   preflight; each has `kind`, `id`, `version`, `fingerprint`). The two forms
   cannot be mixed, and the file form's errors carry no next step.
5. For each repository, `modernpath reverse-engineer capture-source --run ID
   --repository key --root /absolute/root`. Poll `source-status --capture ID`
   until ready; use returned immutable source-file IDs. Interrupted captures
   resume without provider OAuth or FileAnalysis. `read-source --source ID`
   returns exact captured bytes; `read-document --run ID --document ID` returns
   the authorized immutable document snapshot.
6. Prepare the complete requested requirement batch locally: exact UR/SR IDs,
   criteria/scenarios, citations, relationships, stable keys and fingerprints.
   Check duplicates and cross-context joins before the first publication.
   `modernpath reverse-engineer publish --run ID --group stable-key --file group.json`
   publishes a coherent graph atomically. Split only for supported limits or
   dependencies; publish referenced parents first. Retain each returned receipt,
   then perform one consolidated read-back/audit. `status --run ID` recovers
   durable group receipts after interruption; retry identical inputs/keys only
   when needed. Do not derive/publish/read back each row separately.
7. `modernpath reverse-engineer coverage --run ID` measures the frozen inventory
   against stored traces. It separates governed/candidate linkage, captures,
   assessments and exclusions. It is not execution evidence or behavior-class
   enumeration. Follow the publication skill's linked coverage reference for a
   separate behavior-denominator checker; `audit-citations.mjs --min=N` checks
   citation counts/validity, not percentage coverage. `modernpath coverage` does
   not measure retired local ledgers in a store-backed workspace. Read the actual Ledger and Requirements surfaces
   before claiming baseline-ready or candidate-ready.

### Existing-proof verification and acceptance

Run `rdd-reverse-engineer-verify`, then `rdd-reverse-engineer-accept`. These are
separate from normal entry, RED/GREEN and completion. Publication alone supplies
no execution proof. A standalone SR needs no invented Epic or parent. A UR needs
its own UPPER proof and complete current proof for every required SR. Already
DONE dependencies remain proof inputs and are not transitioned again.

#### Resume before collecting proof or opening a decision

Reuse retained current source, execution, delivery and preview identities for
the exact snapshot. Recollect only missing, stale or invalid evidence. If an
acceptance gate exists or answering/applying was interrupted, read
`modernpath reverse-engineer acceptance-status --gate ASBUILT-…` first:

- Current applied receipt: report its lifecycle/compliance states and finish.
- Current approved gate without a receipt: apply the retained exact input.
- Current open gate: reuse its brief/scope and any exact human answer already
  provided in the session; do not ask for that decision again.
- Rejected gate: report rejection without promotion.
- Stale proof/pins: report historical receipts as historical and return to
  verification before fresh review; an old answer cannot approve changed proof.

If the opening response was lost before its gate ID was retained, retry the
identical `acceptance-open` input/key to recover the existing gate. Missing status
is a tooling gap, not proof that there is no gate. Do not preview already DONE
scope as fresh pending work. New verification/acceptance follows these steps.

#### Fresh verification and acceptance

1. Inspect the exact captured code and tests with `read-source`. Bind each
   actual test name to a registered TestCase or a captured test citation's
   `test_case_ref`; inspect the behavior asserted, not only names or counts.
   After changing captured citations on existing pending SR baselines, run
   `modernpath reverse-engineer preflight`, then
   `modernpath reverse-engineer refresh-traces --run CAPTURE-RUN --group stable-key
   --file refresh.json`. Input is exactly `corpus_fingerprint` from preflight and
   `requirements: [{kind: "system", external_id, expected_fingerprint}]`, using
   each requirement's current content fingerprint. The capture run must belong
   to the signed-in actor, be baseline-authorized and contain every persisted
   code/test citation selected. DERIVED grants refuse confirmed refresh links.
   This atomically creates/reuses confirmed immutable source/TestCase links;
   requirement content, criteria, lifecycle and baseline provenance stay intact.
   Existing historical links remain. Rejected, stale, deleted or differently
   governed pairs refuse rather than being revived. UR upper proof uses captured
   citations directly and needs no invented SR links. Retain the returned receipt;
   `status --run CAPTURE-RUN` includes `trace_refreshes` for recovery. Identical
   inputs/key recover the receipt even after acceptance; changed input conflicts.
   A new refresh needs current graph/content fingerprints. Refresh grants neither
   test PASS nor acceptance. `publish` reuse does not refresh existing links.
2. Run the existing tests or inspect genuine retained execution reports.
   `modernpath reverse-engineer execution-proof --file execution.json` records
   through the existing evidence channel and returns durable run/result IDs
   and the exact report digest. It does not execute tests. Input is `key`,
   `kind`, full tested `sha`, actual `ran_at`, exact JSON-string `raw_evidence`
   and `results`. `kind` is `local_test`, `ci`, `browser_verification` or
   `compliance_test_run`. Reusing a key replays the retained execution; changed
   reports or results require a new key. Each result includes `target_external_id`,
   `target_type: "requirement"`, `target_clause`, exact `test_case_ref`,
   `role: "LOWER" | "UPPER"`, `result`, `content_fingerprint`, full `revision`,
   and `detail: {assertion, production_subject}`. The report enumerates
   `executed_tests: [{test_case_ref, result}]`, `command`, `environment` and,
   for CI, `ci: {provider, repository, run, job, attempt, tested_commit}`.
3. For every repository, `modernpath reverse-engineer delivery-proof --file
   delivery.json` takes `key`, `repository_key`, local `root`, exact
   `tested_revision` and captured `snapshot_digest`. It checks the clean
   snapshot before/after fetching the advertised remote default branch and
   retains a distinct integration report in the evidence store. The tested
   revision must be the fetched tip; a failed fetch or non-tip revision refuses.
   The observed `origin` comes from the checkout's Git configuration, including
   local-file remotes. The server does not bind it to a registered provider
   repository. Verify and disclose that origin against the intended repository
   before using the observation as delivery proof; changing origin can change
   what this check proves. Local root is not sent. Retain the returned report/digest. An identical
   retry preserves the original observation and digest; changed intent under
   the same key conflicts. Reuse current retained observations when available.
   This makes no deployment claim.
   For a run inventoried with `--path`, add `--run CAPTURE-RUN`: the command
   reads that run's authorization first and takes its snapshot over exactly the
   files authorized for the repository, so the digest equals the captured one.
   The input JSON is unchanged and the repository must still be clean as a
   whole. `snapshot_digest` must be the digest that run captured: any other
   digest, even that of the current files, refuses and records nothing. The report then also carries
   `authorization_run_id` and `measured_files`. A run that cannot be read, or
   that does not authorize the repository key, refuses before any observation.
   Without `--run` a scoped run's digest never matches the whole repository.
4. `modernpath reverse-engineer proof-preview --file proof.json` evaluates
   without record or lifecycle writes. Input has `version: 1`, `requirements`
   and `delivery`. Each requirement has `kind: "SR" | "UR"`, `external_id`,
   exact `content_fingerprint` and `clauses`. Each clause has `clause`,
   `assertion`, `production_subject`, `code_source_id`, `test_source_id`,
   `run_id`, `result_id` and `report_digest`. Delivery entries are
   `{repository_key, run_id, report_digest}`. `clause` and execution
   `target_clause` name active criterion `external_id` values; the supplied set
   must exactly match every active criterion, with no omissions or duplicates.
   Read eligibility, denominator,
   gaps, exact pending scope and `proof_digest`. Unknown fields refuse.
5. `modernpath reverse-engineer acceptance-open --file acceptance.json` takes
   `key`, exact `proof`, returned `proof_digest` and the standard five-field
   human `brief`: exactly `what`, `why_now`, `changes_if_approved`,
   `risk_if_wrong` and `recommendation`, all nonempty strings. It rechecks proof,
   retains reviewed facts, creates an
   eligibility trace and opens one human decision. Use the retained eligible
   preview for this packet; no extra preview is needed solely to open it.
   Present the exact proof, relevant working-set files and limitations before
   obtaining its answer.
6. After the actual human answer (including an exact answer already provided
   in this session), use the existing
   `modernpath factory answer ASBUILT-… --options approve --text "…" --source
   USER:…`. Its gate read attaches both review pins. The answer boundary
   rechecks current evidence; permission to implement tooling is not acceptance.
7. `modernpath reverse-engineer acceptance-apply --gate ASBUILT-… --file
   apply.json` takes `key`, exact `proof_digest` and `gate_fingerprint`.
   Application rechecks all proof and atomically moves exactly the pending
   named scope to DONE, keeps compliance status unchanged and stores a receipt.
   Any currently authorized signed-in member may apply that exact reviewed
   decision; the receipt retains both answerer and applying actor. Application
   does not supply or replace the human answer.
   Report the receipt, proof currency and lifecycle/compliance states returned
   by this successful apply. Do not add status/list/preview calls or replay the
   write solely to confirm the same result. Use `acceptance-status --gate
   ASBUILT-…` if the response is missing, incomplete or contradictory, or after
   interruption. It separates recorded/applied state, current proof, retained
   reviewed facts and receipt. Identical input recovers the same receipt,
   changed input conflicts, and stale proof cannot replay as current acceptance.

Missing assertions, unexecuted tests, contradictory results, revoked sources or
unmerged delivery stay gaps. Test additions and behavior changes require an
explicit normal-development handoff. Do not fabricate RED, edit a snapshot to
approve it, pass client authority flags, or advance this edge through generic
author/sync operations. These write commands run only from the main session.

### Group JSON contract

`requirements` is a list of `kind: "user" | "system"`, unique `external_id`,
`title`, `description`, `source_citations`, and `criteria`. UR criteria contain
`external_id`, `given`, `when`, `then`; SR criteria contain `external_id` and
`statement`. Supply the UR actor/outcome and SR boundary/verification method.
SR `parent_external_ids` names exact UR parents; a parentless SR needs a rationale.
Do not send authority, approval, release or work-status fields as intent.

File citations use `kind: "code" | "test" | "document"`, `source_file_id`,
`repository_key`, `revision`, `path`, `sha256`, and optional locator fields.
A test citation can retain `test_case_ref` for the exact executed test identity;
the readable `ref` remains the normalized source address.
Document citations use `system_doc_id`, `version`, `fingerprint`; the server
validates them against the run and supplies their readable reference.
Typed citations publish SR→source/test edges and parents publish UR→SR edges.
Citing a test creates a source reference, never a passing test execution.

DERIVED rows require `candidate_packet` with `confirmation_brief` and nonempty
`consequences`; optional `conflicts` and `open_questions` explain ambiguity.
`compares_to: [{"kind":"SR","external_id":"SR-EXISTING"}]` asks the server
to capture an existing governed record. Review shows current versus proposed
content and warns about intervening edits. Never supply fabricated current text.

In baseline mode, explicit nonempty `exception_reason` keeps that individual row
DERIVED and requires a candidate packet. Only candidates may cite an authorized
but unresolved path using `kind: "unresolved"`, `repository_key`, `path`, `reason`.
They cannot be accepted as-built until evidence is resolved. Their links remain
candidate. Baseline receipts separate baselined and DERIVED counts.

To reuse an unchanged existing row, send only `kind`, `external_id` and exact
`reuse_fingerprint`. No incidental overwrite is permitted. Optional `epics`
contain `external_id`, `title`, and nonempty exact `members`; baseline members
must be governed. Do not create Epics to hold DERIVED discovery groups.

`source_assessments` may accompany a group or an empty `requirements` list:
each names `repository_key`, `snapshot_digest`, `path`, `sha256`, `outcome`
(`reviewed`, `unresolved`, `unsupported`) and a nonempty `reason`. Latest durable
assessment wins; an assessment is not a code trace or verified coverage.

### Exact candidate decisions

`candidates` reads typed records and proposed trace IDs. `preview --file selection.json`
takes `requirements: [{kind, external_id, decision}]` and independent `links: [trace-id]`.
Decisions are `accept_as_built`, `accept_desired`, `reject`, `defer`. No Epic is needed.
After explicit approval of that preview, `decide --file decision.json` takes the
same exact selection plus returned `fingerprint`, stable `key` and `source: "USER:…"`.
As-built becomes Base/PENDING_VERIFICATION; desired intent becomes PROPOSED;
rejected becomes OBSOLETE; deferred remains DERIVED. Unselected links remain
candidate and can be accepted later by a links-only selection. Stale fingerprints
require a new preview and decision. None of this approves compliance or DONE.

## 6. Traps

- **255 characters** per bounded authoring field: title, context code, source
  tags, decision refs, ids, option keys. Over it the server refuses the whole
  write with a 422 naming the field (`should be at most 255 character(s)`);
  a length fault the schema does not catch is still a 422 with a reason.
  Long prose goes in `--body` / `--detail` where the verb has it.
- **A push that patches a member record moves the scope context.** The push
  re-stamps every filled section the server then reports stale and says so;
  if `process next` still drops to `plan` with `canonical_sections_incomplete`,
  `process check --phase plan` names the missing or stale keys — author those
  (an unfilled stub is never pushed), or `working-set push --restamp`.
- **A process repin moves no aggregate.** The packet aggregate folds the
  scope's content, membership and canonical sections — not the server's
  compiled process revision (REQ-CROSS-412) — so a process-package repin deploy
  stales no packet and voids no open gate. `process next -v` still prints
  `full process_revision:` as information: which process text a packet was
  reviewed under stays readable, it just no longer pins a decision.
- **Several held pieces, none named.** `process next` prints one block per
  piece; every other scoped read and write refuses by name ("you hold
  several current pieces (…): … — name one with --piece <id>"; the server
  answers 409); `factory status` lists what you hold. Pass `--piece <scope>`.
- **The snapshot header names the store revision the server sent**
  (`store <revision>`, from `x-modernpath-store-revision`), or says the store
  serves none; the CLI's own build is on its own `CLI build:` line. A store
  that serves no revision has not been given one at deploy — not a sign the
  content is stale.
- **The requirements read truncates at its limit** silently; a limit below
  the corpus size gives a wrong "highest id". Ids collide anyway when
  colleagues author concurrently — re-check before minting.
- **Prefer `--from`/`--to` to `--transition`**; a quoted `--transition
  "build->verify"` is still accepted, and an unquoted arrow now fails fast (the
  fragment is refused before any write) instead of landing on an immutable
  trace. Traces recorded with a fragment before REQ-CROSS-377 are inert and
  stay.
- **A withdrawn gate id stays reserved.** Re-scoping means a new id; the
  withdrawn gate may still shadow a finder until the sibling fix lands.
- **A `your-move` label is not a gate id.** Cross-check `external_id` and
  title before reporting a gate as ready or answered.
- **Verify the whole guard, not the first firing arm.** Entry and completion
  refusals are multi-arm; the first message is true but not the whole cause.
- **Record RED evidence before GREEN**, at the RED commit — or afterwards with
  `--revision <red-commit>`; a RED never shadows a pass, and the server warns
  at record time about either ordering mistake. Run `mix` or `go` evidence
  commands from the project's documented root — and every `modernpath` verb
  from the workspace root, never from a subdirectory that carries its own `.modernpath/config.json`.
- **The on-PATH binary can lag `main`.** A merged CLI change is not usable
  until the binary is rebuilt and `modernpath install` has run; a server
  change is not live until deployed. Check `modernpath --version` against
  the merge before relying on a new verb.
- **Session tokens expire mid-session.** The remedy is interactive; report it
  and stop rather than retrying.
