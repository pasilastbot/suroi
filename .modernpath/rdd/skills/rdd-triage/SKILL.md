description: Classify and route backlog discoveries, implementation findings, and user feedback without implementing them. Use to reconcile requirement state, optional epic scope, release selection, conflicts, DERIVED candidates, deferrals, blockers, or changed acceptance. Produce routed records, identify the earliest invalidated process phase, and name the skill that resumes the loop.

# Triage and replan

Read the project `AGENTS.md`, canonical `PROCESS.md`
(`.modernpath/rdd/PROCESS.md` in a consuming repository), backlog, requirement
records, optional epics, current release, gates, evidence, and affected product
sources. Treat user feedback as a source, not an automatic implementation
order.

## Procedure

1. Identify affected requirements, optional epic memberships, acceptance
   content, code, evidence, and approvals.
2. Route an inferred possible requirement to `DERIVED` with candidate links and
   a confirmation gate. Route directly sourced behavior to a `PROPOSED` UR or
   SR.
3. Route missing human authority or ambiguity to a decision gate and apply
   `BLOCKED` only when work cannot proceed honestly. Present the decision
   brief and linked list of relevant working-set files before asking, following `PROCESS.md` §Gates.
4. Route known future work to `DEFERRED` with an attributable human source for
   the postponement, capability/specification gaps to gap records, unclear
   ownership to backlog, and contradicted or removed behavior to an explicit
   conflict or `OBSOLETE` decision.
5. For feedback, determine whether one standalone or UR-linked SR can address
   it without changing user outcome, acceptance, or a cross-cutting decision.
   Otherwise route it to epic-scoped planning.
   Reopen delivered work under the same identity (`PROCESS.md` §Attributable
   demotions). Observed evidence invalidation is an automatic transition with
   agent/check attribution and factual sources; human-directed demotion uses
   a human gate and its `USER:` source. A reversed decision returns work to
   `PROPOSED`. A defect or invalidated required evidence returns affected
   requirements and Epics to `IN_PROGRESS`. Preserve prior acceptance receipts;
   reopening does not waive the entry prerequisites for changing code or tests.
6. Re-evaluate stale gates and evidence, then reconcile authoritative records,
   release scope, work selection, and derived views. Never promote to `TODO`
   without the strict entry gate.

Do not change product code in this pass.

## Report

Report each routed item, attributable source, changed state, stale evidence or
gates, remaining human decisions, and the exact focused skill that resumes the
loop.
