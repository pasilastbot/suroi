name: rdd-verify
description: Establish regression-sensitive UR upper or SR lower evidence for existing behavior after normal development entry, adding or strengthening tests as needed. Use for approved TODO or IN_PROGRESS verification work. Eligible source-scoped baselines with existing proof use rdd-reverse-engineer-verify; DERIVED candidates require confirmation and changed behavior uses rdd-build.

# Verify entered existing-behavior work

Turn behavior described from shipped code into current direct UR upper or SR
lower evidence.

Read the repository `AGENTS.md` and canonical `PROCESS.md`
(`.modernpath/rdd/PROCESS.md` in a consuming repository) before changing a
project repository. `PROCESS.md` owns trace, status, gate, evidence, and
completion meanings.

## Keep the transition honest

This skill verifies existing behavior after normal entry. Eligible source-scoped
baselines with existing proof use `rdd-reverse-engineer-verify` instead. Test
additions or behavior changes on that path require an explicit normal-development
handoff. This skill does not grant human approval or prove delivery.

- Never run this skill for a `DERIVED` requirement. `DERIVED` means no human has
  confirmed that the requirement exists; its proposed links are candidate
  context and all downstream work is held. Apply its confirmation gate first.
- Before tests change, current applied entry approval must cover the whole
  selected delivery scope under `PROCESS.md`, including the Epic when selected.
  The requirement being verified must be `TODO` or `IN_PROGRESS`.
- For an SR, record `LOWER_VERIFIED` and move it to `IN_REVIEW` only when its
  lower trace is current. For a UR, record `UPPER_VALIDATED` and move it to
  `IN_REVIEW` only when its upper trace and required-SR conditions are current.
- Never move a requirement to `DONE` from test evidence alone.
  `DONE` also requires the applicable approval, authoritative-source
  delivery, and reconciliation conditions.
- If the implementation contradicts approved behavior, retain the failing
  evidence and hand the same entered SR to `rdd-build`. Route through planning
  only when satisfying it requires changed scope or a material decision. Do
  not silently change behavior during a verification pass.

## Enter through the same gate as any other change

An authoritative as-built requirement is not itself permission to change tests.
For this normal-development path, apply the entry gate before adding tests.

If the row is `DERIVED`, if a requirement it actually depends on is `DERIVED`,
or if an applicable relation is candidate-only, stop. Do not inspect tests as
though that trace were authoritative, and do not use existing SR evidence to
imply that an inferred user outcome is valid.

Before changing any test, require an authoritative requirement source and its
applicable trace:

```text
UR -> acceptance scenario -> TEST_CASE -> TEST_RESULT
SR -> CODE -> TEST_CASE -> TEST_RESULT
```

Epic membership and UR links are optional. A standalone SR is valid and must
not be sent back to planning merely because it has neither relation. When the
SR is linked to UR acceptance content, record the declared relation; the UR's
upper evidence remains part of the UR trace, not the SR lower trace. When an
epic groups the SR or linked UR, verify that membership only if the selected
scope depends on it.

Use single-SR scope for one independently verifiable SR, whether standalone or
linked to UR acceptance content. Use Epic scope when a UR or multiple
requirements are selected. If establishing the evidence changes a user outcome
or acceptance content, requires another independently implementable SR, or
introduces a cross-cutting decision, return it to Epic-scoped planning. In
either scope, fulfill the current planning, reconnaissance, cold-review,
test-strategy, work-selection, and entry-brief facts.

Check the existing entry approval for the exact selected scope. Reuse current
applied approval and preserve `TODO` or `IN_PROGRESS`; resuming verification
does not reopen entry or move work backwards. If entry is missing or stale,
route to planning and entry before changing tests. Missing entry does not
authorize an additional demotion or a hand-edited status.
Verification stays within the authoritative work selection. The diagnosed-defect
exception in `PROCESS.md` permits a failing test before entry; it does not
authorize this verification pass or implementation.

## Establish the evidence bar

For each row, require all of the following:

1. Resolve its source, code, and test citations.
2. Split the statement and acceptance criteria into behavioral clauses.
3. Name an assertion that would fail if each clause regressed.
4. Confirm the test exercises the real subject rather than a mock that returns
   the expected answer.
5. Confirm the material inputs can **reach** that subject in production — that
   the caller, parser, contract or serializer actually produces the shape the
   test passes in. A real subject invoked with a shape no production path can
   construct verifies a function, not a behavior.
6. Open and read the exact test and its assertions.
7. Run the exact test and confirm from verbose output or runner enumeration
   that it executed.
8. Observe the expected failure before the passing result. For already-shipped
   behavior, use a safe local mutation or equivalent targeted failure, restore
   it immediately, and inspect the diff before continuing.
9. Run proportional regression gates and record evidence against the current
   revision.
10. Cite evidence by stable test path and name, for example
    `TEST:path/to/file:TestName/Subtest`, plus the observed `RUN:` command and
    result. Treat line numbers as optional, unstable navigation hints.

A green suite is not evidence for every clause in a sentence. Underline every
verb and every "and"; a clause without a corresponding failure-producing
assertion remains unverified.

## Work one row at a time

1. Read the row, its acceptance criteria, and every cited source.
2. Search for an existing test by behavior and assertion, not just filename.
3. Use an acceptance/E2E test for a UR scenario and the appropriate focused
   boundary test for an SR clause. If a sufficient test exists, run it and
   demonstrate its relevant failure mode. Otherwise, add the smallest test.
4. Restore any temporary mutation, run the focused test green, then run the
   required regression gates.
5. Update the authoritative requirement, optional related epic, evidence, and
   work-selection records atomically; in a store-backed repository, refresh
   the materialized snapshots afterwards.
6. Advance only the evidence conclusion justified by the run. Move the selected
   requirement to `IN_REVIEW` only if its applicable trace gates pass; otherwise
   leave it at the strongest supported non-final state.
7. Repeat for every approved scenario or clause lacking current evidence. Do
   not request human input for an evidence failure within the approved
   scope. Route changed intent or scope through `rdd-triage`; record an
   external impediment as a blocker.
8. Run the project's deterministic process checks. Deliver and reconcile before
   soliciting completion acceptance; only the subsequent human gate may move a
   requirement to `DONE`.

## Detect verification traps

- **A filter matched nothing.** A runner can print success after executing zero
  tests. Use verbose output or list/count the selected test cases.
- **The source window hid the answer.** Before reporting a contradiction,
  inspect the complete function and its callers rather than a short excerpt.
- **The new test request is invalid.** Prove the production path was entered
  and inspect what collaborators received before blaming the implementation.
- **The test mocks the subject.** A stubbed service can verify the fixture while
  bypassing the behavior named by the row. Leave the row unverified.
- **The subject is real and the input is not.** A hand-built struct, a
  pre-decoded payload, or a field combination the parser cannot emit tests a
  function the production path never calls that way. Trace one material input
  back to its real producer; if nothing constructs it, the clause is unverified.
- **An assertion is satisfied by surrounding UI or fixture data.** Ask what
  production regression would make the assertion fail. If none would, replace
  it.
- **A citation moved.** Prefer stable test names over `path:line`; re-check any
  retained line number after editing.
- **The endpoint was contacted with the wrong payload.** Assert the material
  values and protocol fields named by the requirement, not only a path, status,
  or non-empty response.

## Leave honest gaps

Do not weaken a test to promote a row.

- If the row lacks authoritative requirement support, stop verification and
  route the inconsistent authority through `rdd-triage`. Do not silently rewrite
  its lifecycle, approvals, or relationships.
- If the implementation contradicts approved behavior, retain the failing
  evidence and hand the same entered SR to `rdd-build`. Route through planning
  only when satisfying it requires changed scope or a material decision.
- If verification needs unavailable infrastructure, keep the row
  `PENDING_VERIFICATION` before entry; after entry, use `BLOCKED` and record the
  suspended `TODO` or `IN_PROGRESS` state.
- If only a mocked path is available, record `test run, subject mocked` and
  leave the row unverified.

## Report the pass

Report:

- rows that gained direct evidence and their new evidence/work state;
- rows left unchanged, grouped by reason;
- tests added or reused and confirmation that each relevant failure mode was
  observed before green;
- focused and regression commands run;
- contradictions, discoveries, pending approvals, delivery work, and record
  reconciliation gaps; and
- the exact next handoff: `rdd-completion-review`, `rdd-triage`, or the unmet
  prerequisite.

Exit only when every touched row has current direct evidence or an explicit
reason it remains unverified, all temporary mutations are gone, and repository
state passes its deterministic checks.
